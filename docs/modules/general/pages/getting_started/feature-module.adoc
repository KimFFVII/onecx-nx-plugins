:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

The fastest way to create a new feature module that works with OneCX you can use the OneCX generator.
include::partial$generator-check.adoc[]

******
To run the generator, execute the following command:
----
nx generate <namespaceOfTheGenerator>/nx-plugin:feature <nameOfTheFeature> [--standalone]
----
 
include::partial$generator-namespace-item.adoc[]

* _<nameOfTheFeature>_: The name of the feature to create e.g., theme.

*Options*:

* --standalone: if you want to develop an application that does not depend on onecx-services.

After running the generator, the following actions must be taken:
