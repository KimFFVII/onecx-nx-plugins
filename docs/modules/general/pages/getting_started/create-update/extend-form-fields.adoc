=== Extend form fields

:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

The form fields of the dialog need to be adapted

[#action-1]
==== ACTION C1: Extend schemas inside OpenAPI
_Adapt in File:_  `+<feature>-bff.yaml+`

Extend the 4 generated components to your needs.
Create and Update-Requests need to match your form field values, as they will be key matched. Assure that keys are absolutely equal (upper / lower case, etc.).
Create and Update-Responses are not used yet for anything, you can modify them to your needs and then use them in the corresponding effect.

IMPORTANT: Run the command `npm run apigen` after adapting the OpenAPI to transform the changes into typescript code.

Add new form fields similar to the example one. Key match to your OpenAPI components.
