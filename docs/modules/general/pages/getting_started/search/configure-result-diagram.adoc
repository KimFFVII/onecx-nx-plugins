= Configure the result diagram

:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

By default, a diagram is created which counts the different values in a column and shows the results. To use this diagram, the column which should be displayed needs to be selected first. The member 'columnId' holds the column id of the column.

[#action-9]
== ACTION S9: Select the column to be displayed

Adapt as required where the `+columnId+` is the key for the diagram which shows the distribution of data of the selected column.

_Adapt in File:_ `+<feature>-search.component.html+`

[source, javascript]
----
    // Please select the column to be displayed
    columnId = 'id';
    column = this.columns.find((e) => e.id === this.columnId);
